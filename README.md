# forgery_image
Image forgery detection uses AI and forensics to verify an image's authenticity. It analyzes subtle inconsistencies, like noise patterns or lighting, left by manipulation techniques such as splicing, copy-move, or deepfakes. The goal is to spot doctored images and their tampered areas.
